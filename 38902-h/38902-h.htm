<h2>Preface.</h2>

<h3>EXPLANATORY.</h3>


<p class="idt">I must say a few words in explanation of the somewhat novel form which
my new "Bee-Book" has taken, and which, doubtless, will be a surprise to
the many Bee-Friends who are waiting with exemplary patience for the
second edition of my original "Bee-Book," soon about to appear after an
interval of thirty years from the publication of the first edition.</p>

<p class="idt">I happened last year to be at the Cologne Station, waiting for the
train, and employed my spare time in looking over the book stall for
something to read on my way to Aix-la-Chapelle. The stall was covered
with books about the late War. I had returned from a visit to the Battle
Fields of 1870, and was sick of the subject. I wanted something of a
more peaceful nature, and I was turning away, without making a purchase,
when a book met my eye entitled <i>Schnurrdiburr</i>. What that might mean I
knew not, but the second title, <i>oder die Bienen</i>, was intelligible, and
had attraction enough for me. I opened it, and saw it was profusely
illustrated with very comical cuts. I paid my Thaler and carried away my
prize.</p>

<p class="idt">The cuts are reproduced in the book which my readers have in their
hands. The verses were written up to the pictures rather than translated
from the German text; for alas! my German is very limited; enough for travelling
<span class='pagenum'>iv.</span>
purposes, but hardly enough to enable me to read a Bee-Book
either serious or comical.</p>


<h4>RIDENTEM DICERE VERUM QUID VETAT?</h4>

<p>There is much truth lying hid under these comical stories; still more in
the illustrations; and the notes which I have appended may be found
useful even by serious Bee-Masters.</p>

<p class="idt">I promise my readers that they shall have the second edition of "<span class="smcap">My Bee
Book</span>" as perfect as I can make it, and with as little delay as possible.</p>

<p class="idt">I trust it may be much nearer perfection than the first edition,
published under great difficulties, could be, and I hope it may have as
many purchasers as this its forerunner.</p>

<h4>APIARIAN, CLASSICAL, POETICAL, AND NONDESCRIPT.</h4>

<hr class="half" />
<h4>P R E L U D E.</h4>


<p class="nidt"><span class="smcap">Hail Muse!</span> &amp;c.&mdash;An Invocation to the Muses, both terse and expressive.
Possibly not quite original, as I have a dim recollection that a
certain obscure poet called Byron, whose works are now well nigh
forgotten, made use of it.</p>

<p class="nidt"><span class="smcap">Peggy.</span>&mdash;A name dear to the writer, as that of the first pony which
he ever had of his very own&mdash;the gift of a kind Godfather&mdash;of
a different sex indeed from Pegasus. There is, therefore, some
hopes that the breed may have been preserved, but, as far as my
experience goes, I may regretfully say,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Quando ullam inveniam parem.</p></div>

<p>I have, alas, grown stout; and it requires a strong cob to carry
twenty stone, and go lively under it as well. Such a mount fetches
a long price, which does not suit a short purse; and such Godfathers,
alas! <i>abierunt ad plures</i>; their successors give no such gifts
to their Godchildren.</p>

<p class="nidt"><span class="smcap">Parnassus Green.</span>&mdash;Not at all the same sort of place as Paddington
Green. The latter is now familiarly haunted by our Comic song
writers, those most dolorous of all funny men. Parnassus Green
stands, from the necessity of rhyme, for Green Parnassus.</p>

<p class="nidt"><span class="smcap">Hippocrene.</span>&mdash;The first horse drinking fountain, and produced, moreover,
by a stamp of Peggy's hoof. This would be a good subject for a
drinking fountain of the present day. I make a present of the idea
to any young sculptor who has a commission from one of our
merchant princes, and is hard up for a subject. The most approved
receipt for developing a poetic temperament was to sleep
on Parnassus, and drink of Hippocrene in the morn. Persius has it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Non fonte labra prolui caballino,<br />
Nec in bicipiti somniasse Parnasso<br />
Memini, ut repente sic poeta prodirem."<br />
</p></div>

<p>No more have I; and perhaps some of my readers may say that I
should have done better had I waited for a sleep on Parnassus, and
a drink of Hippocrene before I began to write. All I can say is, I
hope to take one next year, if I visit Greece.</p>

<p class="nidt"><span class="smcap">Fytte I.</span>&mdash;<i>Page 1-7.</i>&mdash;The fun of this first Fytte will be "real nuts" to
every Bee-master. The whole economy of a Hive is viewed from a
human stand-point. The sentinels watching with their own stings
in their hands as lances; the early labours of the chamber and
house maids; the architects setting out the day's work; the swaddling
clothes and pap boat for the Grub Royal; the State of the Queen;
the idleness of the drones: all is well told, at least in the wood cuts.</p>

<p class="nidt">"<span class="smcap">Pig in the Garden strayed around.</span>"&mdash;<i>Page 8.</i>&mdash;A very improper
place for Pig to take his constitutional walk. The wicket gate
which leads to your Hives should be always properly secured, or
results very different from the fattening of a pig may be produced.
For what is possible, though not very probable, see one of the early
chapters of Maryatt's Mr. Midshipman Easy.</p>

<p class="nidt">"<span class="smcap">Was erst all lean, was now all fat.</span>"&mdash;<i>Page 10.</i>&mdash;The alteration
of the animal tissue in consequence of a sting is very wonderful;
it is certainly not fat which is deposited. So that this method of
getting Bacon Pigs ready for market, though it would save corn,
would not be satisfactory to the Bacon Curer when he puts his
flitches in salt, still less to the cook, when frying a rasher.</p>

<p class="nidt">"<span class="smcap">Fly forth, dear Bee, 'tis morn, fly forth.</span>"&mdash;<i>Page 11.</i>&mdash;I shall
be obliged to any one of my many friends, skilled in Musical Composition,
if they will set this original Bee song. The prelude and
refrain offer a fine opportunity for a Buzz-a-Buzz effect. On receipt
of a satisfactory production I will forward to the Composer a bound
copy of <i>Buzz-a-Buzz</i>, with the translator's autograph. Inestimable
reward!</p>

<p class="nidt"><span class="smcap">John Dull sits waiting for a Swarm.</span>&mdash;<i>Page 11.</i>&mdash;as I have done for
many an hour, and lost the swarm after all. John Dull drops asleep
whilst watching. I have often ceased watching just as the swarm
was about to rise. The Bees choose their own time, which is not
always that which the Bee master would for them. But the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
subject of swarming, and how to regulate it, or prevent it, will
be fully treated of in the forthcoming second edition of "My Bee
Book."</p>


<p class="nidt">"<span class="smcap">This honey thief, this Bee-i-cide.</span>"&mdash;<i>Page 14.</i>&mdash;This latter word is
the invention of the learned Doctor Cumming, the Times' Bee-master.
See a most stunning article on his Bee-Book in the Saturday
Review, the second or third number for December, 1864. The
proverbial thickness of a Scotchman's skin can alone have preserved
him from dying from the effects of this stinging article.
"Docte Commenas utriusque linqu&#339;" say I.</p>


<p class="nidt">"<span class="smcap">Cull a Crocus and an Auricula.</span>"&mdash;<i>Page 17.</i>&mdash;The last word was
indeed a difficult one to hitch into rhyme. It has, however, been,
I think, successfully overcome. I might have added another line,
and made a triplet,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Flowers which her Richard loved particular,"
</p></div>

<p>but I had compassion on the ears of my readers.</p>


<p class="nidt"><span class="smcap">"The place I Cannot more define,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span class="smcap">"Within the limits of a line."</span>&mdash;<i>Page 19.</i></span><br />

I well remember, when an Eton boy, walking in the playing fields
with a late revered and beloved prelate, then a Fellow of Eton,
whose memory is dear to every Etonian who knew him, as that of a
kind friend and finished scholar,&mdash;such as alas! seem extinct in these
degenerate days. He was living in a picturesque old house, "The
Warf," now destroyed, that his two sons, then at Eton, might
still have the benefit of home associations. His daughters, and their
French governess, accompanied us in this well-remembered stroll.
Mademoiselle was very curious as to how the Eton boys were punished.
She wanted all the details, and asked if they were whipped
on their backs. The question made us all look foolish, but Dr. L.
with a twinkle of his eyes, which marked his appreciation of the
<i>situation</i>, answered, "A little lower down, Mademoiselle, a little
lower down."</p>


<p class="nidt">"<span class="smcap">Fetched His Bee Dress, his Hive, his Ladder.</span>"&mdash;<i>Page 23.</i>&mdash;A veritable
Guy Mr. Dull looks in his defensive armour! A simpler and
equally efficient dress may be made of a black net bag, large
enough to be drawn over a straw or felt hat, with a brim sufficiently
wide to keep the net away from the prominent organ, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
nose, and long enough to be buttoned into the Bee-master's coat.
A couple of elastic bands round the wrists will prevent the Bees
crawling up his sleeves, the same round the ancles will secure
the most timorous Bee master. "A Lady's dress I cannot pretend
to regulate." See "My Bee Book," where many instances of the
effect of stings are given. When swarming, Bees are particularly
gentle, and never sting, except when some are crushed. A true
Bee-master will despise such defensive armour, but trust rather to
his gentleness and knowledge of the habits of his Bees for his
immunity from stings. Should he be stung, nevertheless, in spite of
all precautions, let him instantly extract the sting, and apply a drop
of honey to the place. This will immediately allay the smarting
pain, and the swelling, except in certain places, as the eye or lip,
be trifling. <i>Eau de Luce</i> as it is commonly called, that is, strong
ammonia, is another excellent remedy; a small bottle should be
kept in every apiary in the box of "needments." But above all,
let the Bee-master eschew gloves, specially when delicate operations
are to be performed. A cat might as soon expect to catch mice
in mittens, as a Bee-master to capture a Queen with hands encased
in, and fingers stiffened by, thick woollen gloves, as recommended
by some.</p>


<p class="nidt">"<span class="smcap">Some way I'll find to stop this Swarming.</span>"&mdash;<i>Page 29.</i>&mdash;It is not to
be done by monster hives, or ventilation, or by adding supers. If
the Bees will swarm, they will. They are a stiff-necked generation,
and know their own business, at least they think so, better
than we men can teach it them. Our objects, however, are slightly
different. Their's to propagate and preserve their species: ours to
secure the maximum amount of honey in any given locality. I
have known a swarm sent forth from a <i>Ruche a l'air libre</i>, a French
Hive, which I worked in New Zealand. The Combs and Bees were
entirely exposed to the external air, which was not then particularly
warm. But a swarm was ready to go, so off they went. For
full particulars of this remarkable instance see "My Bee Book,"
second edition. To regulate, not to prevent swarming should be
the Bee-master's aim. More of this hereafter. I here give, by
the kindness of Mr. Alfred Neighbour, illustrations of the sort
of hive by which alone this can be accomplished, viz., the Bar
Frame hive. Originally of German invention, it, with various modifications,
has been widely adopted both on the Continent and in
America; and every Bee-master in England who claims the title of
scientific, would do well to supply himself at once. Each honey
comb, it will be seen, is built in a separate bar frame like a picture.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>They are ranged to the number of 9, 11, or 13, in a strong box,
and each is both moveable and interchangeable with those of any
other hive. Swarming may be checked in any particular stock
by cutting out the Queen Cells. The great production of drones
can be regulated by limiting the amount of drone cell in any
hive, and altogether prevented by removing it all from a stock
hive, about the purity of whose strain there is the least doubt;
whilst again, it may be encouraged in a pure blooded stock hive,
by inserting at the proper time an additional bar containing drone
comb. Any man handy with tools may make them for himself at
the cost of the materials, and they will last a lifetime. I can supply
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>my friends with as many as they require at half a guinea, for which
they pay double or treble in the shops; whilst those who think nothing
can be good except it is high-priced, and do not like the trouble of
making their own hives, may go to any cost they like. The preceding
woodcut represents a hive on this principle, but with certain modifications,
which may be obtained of Mr. Neighbour, 149, Regent-street,
and will suit the class of Bee keepers last mentioned. Mr.
Neighbour has, I may mention, made arrangements for supplying
Ligurian Queens of the greatest purity.</p>

<p class="nidt"><span class="smcap">"A dancing Bear by trade was he,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span class="smcap">"And Honey loved exceedingly."</span>&mdash;<i>Page 35.</i></span><br />

This "Bar" story is an addition to, and improvement on, one which I
recollect to have read in some American publication. A man who
had dropped into a hollow tree is hoisted up by the same "living
ladder." He, if I remember rightly, grasped the hinders of the Bear
with one hand, and with the other prodded him with his Bowie
knife, so as to change his descending into an ascending motion.</p>


<p class="nidt"><span class="smcap">Honey Cakes.</span>&mdash;The French use the word <i>Gateaux</i>. I wish the name
"Honey Cakes" were universally adopted by Bee-masters. It would
supply a meaning which the word "comb" does not at all. A honey
comb may be as dry as dust, whilst the "honey cake" places before
the eyes of the imagination a full comb well sealed over, with here
and there a drop of clear honey oozing out, as a sample of the
store within. Perfectly sealed honey cakes may be kept without
deterioration through the winter, by wrapping them up separately
in clean writing paper, and then packing them away in a tin, each
cake being placed as it stood in the hive. If Bar-Frame Hives
are used, the cakes should not be cut away from the frame till
wanted; they should be stored away in some close box, fitted to
receive them.</p>


<p class="nidt">"<span class="smcap">And Cover Him From Top To Toe.</span>"&mdash;<i>Page 43.</i>&mdash;Bee literature contains
many instances of persons having been completely enveloped in a
swarm of Bees, who by remaining perfectly still did not receive a
single sting. Old Thorley, in his &#924;&#949;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#945; tells the story
of his maid-servant being so covered in a manner very quaint and
charming. Perfect quiet under these circumstances is essential to, and
will secure, safety; whilst any thing which can enrage 20,000
soldiers, armed with a poisoned dart, may lead to fatal results.
Since I wrote the above, a story has appeared in the newspapers,
and is, I fear a true one, as names, dates and places are given, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
a sting having been fatal to a lady accustomed to the management
of bees. Any person who has this idiosyncrasy had better give bees
a wide berth.</p>

Is the refrain of the well-known chorus in the Frogs of Aristophanes.
Any one with an accurate ear, who has been so happy
as to assist at a chorus of Bull Frogs in full song in the sweet
spring tide, sacred to love and melody, must have felt how accurately
the great Comic Poet noted down their song. I do not believe
that in the two thousand years which have elapsed since that time
there has been a single note altered in their love ditty. I have
never been in Greece, and so cannot testify to the musical powers of
the Frogs of B&#339;otia; but I have had that pleasure both in Spain and
in the neighbourhood of Constantinople: in both instances under very
favourable circumstances, which I will relate. In June, 1855, during
the Crimean war, I was at Constantinople, the guest of Lord Napier,
then Chief Secretary to the British Embassy in that city. He was
residing at that lovely place, Therapia, the summer retreat of our
Ambassador and his suite. I had pitched my little tent in a grass
meadow, close to Lord Napier's snug house. His hospitality by day
was unbounded, but straitened as he was for room by night, he was
not sorry to entertain a guest who delighted in camping out, and
brought with him the means of doing so. Not fifty yards from my
tent was a dark stagnant pool, overshadowed by trees, and every
night and all night long the Bull frogs, from their reedy habitations,
sang "Brekekekex, Coax, Coax," whilst above the water, and in
and out of the dark shadows of the trees, the fire flies flickered
about in their ever varying gambols. It was as though Taglioni, resplendent
with Jewels, had been dancing her very best to the strains
of a Scotch bag-pipe. Again, I was in the noble town of Seville
at Easter, 1867, twelve years later, during which time I had been
hard at work in England, and "no holiday had seen," so by that
time I needed one. Not a hundred yards from the glorious Cathedral,
behind the Alcazar, the old Palace of the Moors, is a large
orange garden, and in the midst of it a square tank, of Moorish work,
used for irrigation. The garden was tenanted by a widow woman
who owned a dozen or so magnificent stall-fed milch cows, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
thither I resorted early every morning, after visiting the Cathedral,
for the sake of a glass of new milk, and a lesson in Spanish from
her two little daughters aged respectively nine and ten, Incarnacion
(the last c pronounced th) and Salud. Commend me to two
chattering little girls, when their shyness has once worn off, as the
best teachers of a new language. One glorious morning I was
sitting on the edge of the aforesaid tank, inhaling the delicious
perfume of the orange blossoms, when a Frog struck up his
"Brekekekex, Coax Coax" from the still water, and at the same time
the air was resonant with the sweet song of the Nightingale. I
pride myself on knowing somewhat of the languages of Birds,
Beasts, and (Fishes? No! they are mutum pecus, but let us say) Bull
Frogs so I listened attentively, and found the Nightingale and Bull
Frog, were each of them serenading his own wife, arboreal, and
aquatic. Each wife thought her husband the very best singer in
the world: that not a note of his song could be altered for the
better; and both Nightingale and Bull Frog thought the other singer
a bore. I noted down the whole of this musical contest at the time.
It is quite in the way of one of Virgil's Am&#339;b&#339;an Bucolics. Not
Corydon and Thyrsis, but Batrachos and Philomela were contending
for the prize. It is too long to insert here, but may be had of my publishers,
under the title of "Bull Frog and Nightingale;" an Apologue,
price 6d. But the sum of the whole matter is this: I do not
believe, "pace Darwinii nostri dicatur," that natural selection, and
conjugal preference has had the effect of altering or improving the
Nightingale's song in the last two thousand years. It could not be
louder or better, and I trust may last my time unchanged, whilst on
the evidence of Aristophanes' chorus we know that Bull Frogs, then,
as now, sang "Brekekekex, Coax, Coax," <i>and that song only</i>.</p>


<p class="nidt"><span class="smcap">The Honey Pot.</span>&mdash;<i>Page 47-52.</i>&mdash;This Fytte, comical as it is in itself, is
particularly valuable as instructing the untravelled Britisher in the
peculiarities of a German bedstead; far too short for all who have
not by some Procrust&#339;an process been reduced to the normal height
of five feet, no inches! the upper sheet sown to the coverlid,
with no possibility of tucking it in, and liable to fall off the sleeper
altogether. No blankets, but a mountain of feather-bed piled above,
which either stifles you in summer, or rolling off, leaves you to
freeze in the winter. Yet in such a bed as this what wonderful
positions Mr. Dull managed to assume under the influence of fear.
Imitate him, my gentle reader, if you are still young and active,
and then you will appreciate his contortions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p class="nidt">"<span class="smcap">A Honey Thief, ill may he thrive.</span>"&mdash;<i>Page 55.</i>&mdash;Every Bee keeper
will echo this wish. I know no sight more piteous than an apiary
the night after it has been plundered. Light Hives upset, and lying,
with the combs all broken, on the ground. The Bees crawling about
in wild confusion around their violated homes, lately so neat, and
now the very picture of desolation. In vain they attempt to repair
the damage which the spoiler's hand has created; whilst the stands
where the heavy stocks stood the evening before, are one and all tenantless.
Many devices to protect Hives from robbers have been tried.
Wooden boxes are tightly screwed to the bottom board from below,
whilst the bottom board itself is strongly bolted to the stand. This
will indeed protect a hive from anything but a powerful crow bar.
But the remedy is worse than the disease, as it prevents your ever
changing or cleaning the bottom board, and is, in many ways,
inconvenient. The best preservative I can think of is to have a
savage dog, savage to all but his master, with a strong chain, not
fastened to his kennel, but ending in an iron ring, which can slide
along a small pole placed horizontally about a foot from the ground
in front of the Hives. I have seen this mode of defence adopted
in Germany for the protection of the valuable Leech ponds, which
are there fattened for the market. It answers for the defence of
Leeches, and if so, why not for Bees.</p>


<p class="nidt">"<span class="smcap">Many a nose, upturned, was Snoring in Repose.</span>"&mdash;<i>Page 66.</i>&mdash;My
readers will doubtless remember, as I confess to have done
when penning the above line, the opening of Southey's Thalaba,
and the inimitable parody thereof in the Rejected Addresses.
When a thing has been done excellently well, it is folly to again
attempt the same with a certainty of failure before our eyes. We
verse makers do not steal from each other; we are all one brotherhood,
and <i>Corbies nae pike out corbies e'en</i>. But we convey&mdash;<i>conveys</i>
the word, says glorious Will.</p>

<span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span class="smcap">"The felon to the prison door."</span>&mdash;<i>Page 66.</i></span><br />

This mode of removing a captive would have suited that extinct
species of our protective force, that of the Dogberry and Verges
order, and may be recommended to our new police as more merciful,
and less grating to the feelings of a prisoner than the present
mode of "running a man in;" especially as they generally get hold of
the wrong person. A police sedan would enable the innocent captive
to conceal his features from the tail of little boys and idle quidnuncs,
specially if he were carried like our honey thief head downwards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p class="nidt"><span class="smcap">The</span> last Chapter is like the first, written in the style of the Butterfly's

on the concluding lines:</p>

Baierische Bier is infinitely superior to any Hippocrene. But no
drink in the world can hold a candle to genuine "Wienische Bier," as
it comes cool drawn from the cellar. The Romans knew not beer, and
so had to put up with "Falernian," or even the "vile C&#339;cubum."
I say put up, for the wine that now goes by the name of Falernian is
detestable. I suppose, however, that two thousand years ago it
was far more carefully made, as I trust it may again be in
"Italia Unita." The Romans, knew not beer, but the Greeks
had tasted it, though brewed by the hands of barbarians. In
Xenophon's Retreat of the Ten Thousand we are told that they
came upon a race of people from whom they got</p>

like Baron Munchausen's famous steed, he hath not the wherewithal
to stow away his beer. My dear old Peggy, alluded to in the first
of this series of notes, and therefore the fittest subject for a wind up,
was, when hard worked, very fond of a quart of good ale, with
half a quartern loaf broken into it; she would drink up the ale

vigour for another ten-mile trot.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
